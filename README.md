# Yet-Another-Posting-System
Yet Another Posting System (YAPS) is a simple posting system written with C# and WPF. This project was originally the final project for my University OOP course.

## build
prerequisites:
- Visual Studio
- .NET

Building this project should be as easy as loading it into Visual Studio and building it. Visual Studio should handle all of the dependencies by itself.

## Credits
